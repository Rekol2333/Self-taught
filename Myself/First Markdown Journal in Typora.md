# First Markdown Journal in Typora

**W**hen the first ` # + title` worked, which is Markdown's syntax, and shown for me, I lost myself in this magical display .

- I swear myself that  ***I must learn how to use it and play it well.*** 

But sadly. some markdown syntax do not support well, like bold italics and others, don’t have found. Finally, I discovered that how to make ***BOLD ITALICS***, So easy, wasn’t it?

It would be proved that the `Newsprint`, one themes of Typora inside,  can improve the interest of writing by English.

``` java
public class HelloDemo{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        System.out.println("Hello Typora");
    }
}
```

All like these,  making me more patient and desired.

Thanks Typora and Markdown, for let me know I can do these and more.

Thank you.
